# if statements are used to test for particular conditions and respond appropriately.
# They are used to control the flow of a program.
# The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is true, the code block following the if statement is executed.
# If the condition is false, the code block following the if statement is skipped and the code block following the else statement is executed.
# The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.
# The elif statement is used to test multiple conditions.
# The elif statement is used to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.
# The elif statement is short for "else if".
# The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.
# The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

# Example 1: Using the if statement
x = 10
y = 20

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")

# Output: x is less than y
    
# Example 2: Using the if statement
x = 10
y = 20

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")


# Common uses of if statements in real world applications:
# 1. To check if a user is authenticated
# 2. To check if a user is authorized
# 3. To check if a user is logged in
# 4. To check if a user is registered
# 5. To check if a user is active
# 6. To check if a user is blocked
# 7. To check if a user is banned
# 8. To check if a user is suspended
    
# Example 3: Using the if else statement
    
x = 10
y = 20

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is less than y")


# Output: x is less than y
    
# Example 4: Using the if elif else statement
x = 10
y = 20

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")

# Output: x is less than y
